# Effect-of-TrainTest-Split-Ratio
In this notebook, I tried to investigate the effect of train-test split ratio on the performance of the model. I used Wine Data set and looked into the performance of Linear Regression when the training dataset has 60%, 70% and 80% of the whole dataset.

*As we can see, the perfomance increases when we increase the percentage of training dataset.
The performance of both training and test increases with the increase the percentage of training dataset.
